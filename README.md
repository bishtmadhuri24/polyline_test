# polyline_test

# ðŸš€ Flutter Polyline Animation App

This Flutter project renders animated polylines between multiple points on a Google Map and fulfills a requirement to render the polyline within **1 second** after loading.

---

## ðŸ§­ How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bishtmadhuri24/polyline_test

   flutter pub get

   flutter run
   

## Getting Started


The requirement to render the polyline within 1 second was fulfilled using the following strategies:

Optimized decoding and rendering: As soon as the polyline coordinates are received from the API, they are decoded and added to the map using a high-priority Bloc state update.

Asynchronous processing: Network request and polyline rendering were handled asynchronously with precise timing and minimal UI lag.

Debouncing: Avoided unnecessary re-rendering or multiple rebuilds during the process.

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
