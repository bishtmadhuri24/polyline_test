# üìç Flutter Polyline Renderer

This Flutter application reads GPS coordinate data from a local JSON file and displays:
- A **polyline route**
- **Markers** at each point
- **Circles** representing location accuracy  
on an interactive map using the `flutter_map` package.

---

## üöÄ Features

- Read location data from a `.json` file
- Plot polyline route from points
- Draw accuracy-based circles around each point
- Render everything on-screen **within 1 second**
- State managed using `flutter_bloc`

   flutter pub get

   flutter run
   

## Getting Started


The requirement to render the polyline within 1 second was fulfilled using the following strategies:

Optimized decoding and rendering: As soon as the polyline coordinates are received from the API, they are decoded and added to the map using a high-priority Bloc state update.

Asynchronous processing: Network request and polyline rendering were handled asynchronously with precise timing and minimal UI lag.

Debouncing: Avoided unnecessary re-rendering or multiple rebuilds during the process.

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
